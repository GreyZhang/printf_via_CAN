* printf via CAN
** summary
- When we design an embebed system we usally use a printf function via UART. 
Yet, it is difficult to use that function on an automobile ECU because 
most ECU do not have UART design. Instead, they have CAN! It is really a pity 
to give up so many tools which are popular on many fields, so we need some 
function to covert CAN messages into UART. Of course this would need some
hardware. But the good news is that we can choose so many open source hardware
such as arduino.

** hardware
- Here I use arduino UNO with a MCP2515 CAN chip extended with SPI on it. This
is convenient because we just need an USB cube and no other power supply wire
is needed.
